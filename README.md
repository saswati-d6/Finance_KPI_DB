Objective- To develop a comprehensive Finance Dashboard that provides insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyse performance effectively.

Awesome Chocolates is a fictitious manufacturing company that produces organic wholesome chocolates. The management team needs a way to track KPIs, compare monthly performance, analyze sales trends, and identify top performing salesperson.

The dashboard showcases the company's chocolate sales analytics. We calculated various measures to examine actual sales, target sales, variance. We took an in-depth look at the performance of each salesperson from the different teams, YTD values for key metrics like actual sales, target sales and variance. The underlying data model represents a star scheme where the two fact tables (Actual and Targets) are connected to the dimension tables (people and calendar) via relationships, based on a common field or keys.
